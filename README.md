# Telegram Bot for Stock Updates

The following is a telegram messenger bot which will send automatic stock change updates. You will have to create a telegram messenger token and chat id in order to get started - these should stay private to you!

## Configure cfg.py
Once you have your token and chat id, you can go into cfg.py and edit the file.

"stock"  -> give the stock symbol inside the list. Can give 1 or 100. 

"timer"  -> give the timer you want the stock list to give you updated prices.

"token"  -> your telegram bot token.

"chatid" -> your telegram bot chat id.

## Running bot
Once cfg.py is configured you can go into your terminal and run main.py. You can configure this to run in the background or as a startup process for your computer/laptop.
